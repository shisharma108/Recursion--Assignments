Send Feedback
Given k, find the geometric sum i.e.
1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... + 1/(2^k) 
using recursion.
Input format :
Integer k
Output format :
Geometric sum
Constraints :
0 <= k <= 1000
Sample Input 1 :
3
Sample Output 1 :
1.875
Sample Input 2 :
4
Sample Output 2 :
1.93750
ans is the variable in which we have stored the answer which will be returned by sum fucntion


we need to truncate the decimal places of answer we get to 5


so this format is used 


format is the in built function in which we have passed our answer


and wrote {0:.5f}


this means till 5 decimal places



def sum(n):
    if n==0:
        return 1
    return 1/pow(2,n)+sum(n-1)
n=int(input())
ans = sum(n)
print("{0:.5f}".format(ans))
